# bomber-core

A clojure application for prank people. App send POST requests with phone number to other services, and they send back a sms or call on given number.

It's a part of my architectural microservices project, and fun with clojure lang. Made just for educational reasons.

If you know how to improve it make pull request, or write me directly.
